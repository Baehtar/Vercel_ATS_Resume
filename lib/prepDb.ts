          difficulty: "Medium",
          hint: "Think about normalization, query performance, and storage trade-offs.",
          sample_answer:
            "A Star Schema has a central fact table connected to denormalized dimension tables, making queries simpler and faster. A Snowflake Schema normalizes dimension tables into sub-dimensions, saving storage but requiring more joins. Star Schema is preferred for read-heavy analytics workloads (data warehouses), while Snowflake Schema suits scenarios where storage cost matters and data integrity is critical.",

          difficulty: "Easy",
          hint: "Consider readability, recursion support, and query optimization.",
          sample_answer:
            "CTEs (WITH clauses) define temporary named result sets that improve readability and allow recursion. Unlike subqueries, CTEs can be referenced multiple times. Use CTEs for complex, multi-step transformations and subqueries for simple one-off filters.",

          hint: "Think about indexing, partitioning, query execution plans, and materialized views.",
          sample_answer:
            "Steps: 1) Analyze the execution plan (EXPLAIN ANALYZE). 2) Add appropriate indexes (B-tree for equality, GIN for full-text). 3) Partition the table by date or region. 4) Use materialized views for pre-aggregated data. 5) Avoid SELECT *. 6) Consider denormalization if joins are the bottleneck.",

          sample_answer:
            "Pandas runs on a single machine and is best for datasets that fit in memory (up to a few GB). PySpark distributes data across a cluster and handles terabytes. Choose Pandas for EDA and small datasets; PySpark for production ETL pipelines processing large-scale data.",

          sample_answer:
            "Architecture: 1) Extract: Use requests with retry/backoff. 2) Transform: Validate schema with Pydantic, clean nulls, deduplicate. 3) Load: Use SQLAlchemy with upsert (INSERT ON CONFLICT).

          sample_answer:
            "Batch processing handles large volumes of data at scheduled intervals (e.g., nightly Spark jobs aggregating daily sales). Stream processing handles data in real-time as it arrives (e.g., Kafka consumers detecting fraud in payment transactions). Batch is simpler and cheaper; streaming provides lower latency.",

          sample_answer:
            "Airflow is a workflow orchestration platform with dependency management, retry logic, monitoring UI, and alerting. Unlike cron, it handles task dependencies (Task B waits for Task A), provides visibility into failures, and supports backfilling.

          sample_answer:
            "Use Kafka with idempotent producers and transactional consumers. Assign unique message IDs and use deduplication at the consumer level. Write to the sink using upserts (idempotent writes). Use checkpointing in Spark Structured Streaming. For databases, use transactional outbox patterns.",

Steps: 1) Define hypothesis (H0: no difference). 2) Calculate sample size using power analysis (based on desired significance level α=0.05, power=0.8, and minimum detectable effect). 3) Run test until sample size is reached. 4) Calculate p-value; reject H0 if p < α.",

Example: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated (both increase in summer) but ice cream doesn't cause drowning. The confounding variable is hot weather. To establish causation, you need controlled experiments (A/B tests).",
